## About Enkisoftware
[www.enkisoftware.com](https://www.enkisoftware.com)  

We are [@dougbinks](https://github.com/dougbinks) and [@juliettef](https://github.com/juliettef). We are independent game developers and consultants specialising in game engines, computer graphics, voxel technology and software testing.  

We develop [Avoyd](https://www.avoyd.com), our voxel editor, renderer and game whilst providing contract services to the games industry. In the process we create and maintain open source software for game developers.

## Open Source Projects
In the process of developping Avoyd we create and maintain the following open source software for game developers.  

You can support our OSS development effort through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dougbinks) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/enkisoftware).
