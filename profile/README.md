## About Enkisoftware
[www.enkisoftware.com](https://www.enkisoftware.com)  
We are [@dougbinks](https://github.com/dougbinks) and [@juliettef](https://github.com/juliettef). We are independent games developers and consultants specialising in computer games, information technology and software testing. 
We develop our voxel editor and game [Avoyd](https://www.avoyd.com) whilst providing contract services to the games industry.  

## Open Source Projects
In the process of developping Avoyd we create and maintain the following open source software for game developers.  

You can support our OSS development effort through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dougbinks) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/enkisoftware).
